                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I graduated in 2019 with BioResource Science & Engineering at University of Washington. BioResource Science & Engineering has similar fundamentals with Chemical Engineering, but more emphasized on pulp & paper production and biofuel. However, currently I am working in a slightly different field as manufacturing engineer in a test devices company in greater Seattle area. My work responsibilites include but not limited to troubleshooting and optimizing processes in production setting - which most of the time is related to mechanical aspect. 
                        However, due to supply chain issues, my tasks have been more related to an electrical engineer role - qualifying cable harnesses, wires, and connectors. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my last quarter in the UW, I took coding class and realized that I have passion and interest in the tech world. After 2 years working full time as a manufacturing engineer, it's time for me to learn new skills by joining UW coding bootcamp with the goal of being an all-rounder engineer.
