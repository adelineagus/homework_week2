# homework_week2

The goal of this week's homework is to create portfolio with .html and .css files that are created from scratch. This starter portfolio will be updated as more projects and applications are created throughout this course and/oor in the future. The main goal of this portfolio is to utilize CSS variables and creating responsive layout (utilizing flexbox). 

Achievements:
When the portfolio is loaded, developer's name and photo are presented. Portfolio consists of the following sections: about, applications, and contact info. When navigation link is clicked, users are redirected to corresponding section. On application section, users are presented with titled image of developer's applications (for now they are all placeholder images) with first application's image being larger than others. When applications' images are clicked, users are re-directed to deployed website of the application (for now, they are all re-directed to google website). When users resize the page, they will be presented with responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
